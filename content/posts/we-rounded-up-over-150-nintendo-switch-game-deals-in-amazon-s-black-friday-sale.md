Nintendo's official Black Friday promotion begins this Sunday, November 23, but with sales events running already at Amazon and Best Buy, you already have a massive selection of discounted Switch and Switch 2 games to choose from. If you clicked on this article earlier in the week, you browsed a list of roughly 85 deals on physical games for Switch 1/2. Many of the early Black Friday Switch deals are still available, but they have been joined by so many others. Our list has practically doubled in size, so now Switch and Switch 2 players have around 170 game deals to check out below. And if you haven't already, you may want to bookmark this page, because we'll continue to update this roundup throughout Black Friday and Cyber Week.

We separated Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch games into two lists, but keep in mind that original Switch games are playable on Nintendo's new console. Some original Switch games have received free or paid Switch 2 upgrades, and others simply run better on the more powerful hardware by default.
Black Friday Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals
The Nintendo Switch 2 list is, rather unsurprisingly, significantly shorter than the Switch list, but there are numerous titles on sale for all-time low prices, including recent releases like Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, Little Nightmares III, Cronos, and Star Wars Outlaws: Gold Edition, which is discounted to $40 (was $60) at Amazon. The sports game deals are even better than earlier in the week, as Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and NBA 2K26 are going for $30 (was $70) each. Harry Potter fans can get the Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy for a new all-time low of $45 (was $60).
