Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.
On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.
"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. "I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast."
