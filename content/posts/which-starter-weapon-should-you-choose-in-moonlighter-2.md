# **Picking Your Path in Moonlighter 2: Which Starter Weapon Will Lead You to Victory?**

When you embark on your journey in *Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault*, your very first decision might just be your most pivotal one - choosing the right starter weapon. Like a knight selecting their sword or a wizard choosing their wand, your weapon in this game is more than just a tool; it’s a partner that will grow with you through countless dungeons and endless encounters. So, what’s on the weapon rack at the start? Let’s dive into the choices and see which suits your playstyle like a glove!

### **1. Merchant's Sword: The Balanced Blade**

First up is the classic Merchant’s Sword. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of the game world - balanced, reliable, and always ready for action. This weapon offers a four-hit primary attack pattern. The clincher? The final strike doubles as a heavy-hitting finisher, packing that extra punch when you need it. And for those moments surrounded by adversity, the sword’s special move is a powerful spinning attack that has Will, your protagonist, dealing significant damage in an effective 360-degree arc. This weapon is ideal for those who love consistency and fluid combat rhythm. Strategy tip: Time your combos to maximize your finishing blow!

### **2. Merchant's Large Sword: The Power Play**

If subtlety isn’t your style and you prefer to make an entrance with impact, the Merchant’s Large Sword just might be your calling. This weapon is the heavy hitter of the initial lineup, offering a three-hit pattern of slow, lumbering, yet devastating attacks. However, it’s not just about blind strength. The sharpness mechanic requires precision; the more sharpness you maintain, the deadlier your blows. Don’t worry, though; the special move—a quick jab attack—restores sharpness, allowing you to return to your maximum damage output in no time. This is the choice for gamers who pride themselves on strategic play and managing resources wisely to unleash ultimate destruction.

### **The Dilemma: Strategy or Strength?**

Now comes the key question: Which should you choose? Your decision might boil down to the classic RPG battle of finesse versus muscle. The sword is your go-to for reliable, adaptable combat that doesn’t miss a beat, perfect for players who crave versatility. Meanwhile, the large sword offers a nuanced, tactical approach to combat that emphasizes planning and execution to leverage your full potential. 

### **Conclusion: Prepare for Adventure**

Ultimately, your choice of weapon in *Moonlighter 2* is a reflection of your battle philosophy. Will you strike with deliberate precision and careful resource management, or will you opt for a more balanced approach, ready to tackle a variety of challenges head-on? Whatever path you choose, remember that each swing, slash, and special move is your tool to crafting your story within this beautifully crafted world. Prepare, strategize, and head bravely into the vault with your chosen partner!

Whether you align with the Merchant’s Sword or the Merchant’s Large Sword, you’re poised for an unforgettable adventure in *Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault*. Ready your weapon, hone your strategy, and let the dungeon delving begin!
