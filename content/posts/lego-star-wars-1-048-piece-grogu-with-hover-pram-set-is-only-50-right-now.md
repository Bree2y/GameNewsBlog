The Mandalorian fans have another chance to secure Amazon's Black Friday deal on the adorable Lego Star Wars Grogu with Hover Pram building set. The 1,048-piece model is 50% off, lowering the price to just $50 (was $100). Amazon first offered this deal on November 13 before the Black Friday sale officially kicked off. Unsurprisingly, Amazon has sold out multiple times over the past week, so the deal is unlikely to remain in stock for very long.
Grogue with Hover Pram is one of two official Black Friday Lego deals at Amazon (so far); the other deal is on a nostalgic diorama based on a scene from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The 502-piece Boarding the Tantive IV diorama is up for grabs for only $38.49 (was $55).
