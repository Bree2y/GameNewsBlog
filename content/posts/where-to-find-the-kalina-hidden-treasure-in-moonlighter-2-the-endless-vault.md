# Unraveling the Secrets: Discover the Kalina Hidden Treasure in Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault

Calling all treasure hunters and Moonlighter fans! If you're venturing into the mystical depths of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, there's a dazzling quest waiting to test your treasure-seeking prowess. In the early stages of the game, our fearless companion Eris gifts us a quest that sends players on a hunt for the elusive hidden treasure within the enigmatic dungeons of Kalina. It's a task that promises more than just the thrill of the chase - it leads to a coveted reward that will elevate your gaming arsenal! Intrigued? Let's dive into the details.

### The Quest for Kalina's Secret Stash

Once you accept the quest, the challenge is set: find the hidden treasure in Kalina, the first dungeon you have access to. But hold your horses – this isn’t a straightforward GPS-guided voyage. Lady Luck, in the form of RNG (Random Number Generator), adds a sprinkle of unpredictability to your treasure-hunting expedition. But fear not, adventurer, with our insider tips, you’ll be one step closer to discovering the hidden rewards that await you.

### Navigation: The Key to Treasure

To uncover the hidden treasure, your journey begins in the Blacksmith room—keep an eagle eye out for the hammer icon on the room map screen. Typically appearing about halfway through your dungeon run, this room is your gateway to greater riches.

Once you enter the Blacksmith room, an often-overlooked path holds the key to your quest. Turning right takes you to a concealed path, artfully camouflaged by a rock formation. Venture through, and you'll stumble upon a mysterious green portal.

### Challenge Accepted: Overcoming Obstacles

Step through that portal, and brace yourself for an adrenaline-charged trap-filled obstacle course. It's not all smooth sailing, as you’ll encounter two types of traps determined to hinder your progress: bear traps and wind traps. But here’s where your agility shines! With a hero's roll, zoom past those bear traps. Thanks to the game’s forgiving rolling mechanism, you can weave through obstacles with finesse.

### The Reward? Worth the Adventure!

Emerging victorious from the trap-laden gauntlet, you’ll claim your prize: a blueprint for "The Vow," a formidable large sword that promises to boost your combat capabilities and awe your foes.

So, fellow adventurers, equip your gear, sharpen your wits, and set forth on this thrilling quest in Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault. The treasure of Kalina is yours for the taking—claim it, and let your legend grow!
