# Fortnite x Stranger Things: A New Era Begins with Familiar Faces

**Fortnite fans, gear up for a nostalgia-driven showdown as the iconic universe of Stranger Things is set to invade the virtual battlefield once again!** It's been six thrilling years since Fortnite first welcomed players to a world where Hawkins and the Upside Down collided. Back then, fans were treated to a digital encore starring Eleven, Sheriff Hopper, and ominous portals scattered across the map. But with the Netflix phenomenon's fifth and final season on the horizon, a fresh batch of Hawkins' own is making its way into the Fortnite mix with a twist!

Epic Games just dropped the bombshell that **Mike, Dustin, Will, and Lucas** are joining the digital fray in Fortnite's Blitz Royale mode. It's a bittersweet reunion though, as beloved characters Max, Steve, Nancy, Jonathan, and Robin didn’t get an invitation this time. The vibrant new artwork teased by Epic Games showcases the now mostly-grown-up Stranger Things kids enveloped in a chilling backdrop teeming with portals—and an ominous appearance from Vecna himself, the chief antagonist from the series.

These beloved characters will soon don bespoke Fortnite skins, serving up nostalgia with a stylish twist! Expect to see those quintessential Upside Down designs weaved into the Fortnite Blitz Royale map, delivering an immersive experience packed with thrills, chills, and, naturally, hordes of opponents to outlast.

Already excited? The Stranger Things skins are dropping in the Fortnite store as we speak! Although the legendary outfits of Eleven, Sheriff Hopper, and the menacing Demogorgon aren't currently available, there's a buzz in the air that they could stage a comeback. Keep your V-Bucks at the ready because this crossover just might lure them back from the digital archives.

Get ready to dive back into the eerie world of Stranger Things—this time, as seasoned Fortnite players! Battle it out, Hawkins style, and take your squad through a nostalgic whirlwind of friendship, adventure, and cosmic stakes. It's time to band together and tackle whatever the Upside Down may throw at you. Remember, in this world, with great skins come great battles. So, are you ready to face the storm? Let the games begin!
