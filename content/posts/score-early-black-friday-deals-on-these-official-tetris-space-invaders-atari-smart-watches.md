The Apple Watch might be the best-selling watch on the planet, but if you're seeking something more interactive, you'll want to check out these early Black Friday deals on watches inspired by classic gaming consoles and games like Atari 2600, Space Invaders, and Tetris.

Check out all the discounted models below.

While these watches are labeld as "smart" watches, they're not smart watches in the typical sense of the word. Notably, they lack Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, so don't expect to pair them with your smartphones or receive push notifications from mobile apps. It will, however, track your heart rate, steps, and calories burned, and you can play handful of retro games on each model. The action takes place on a 2-inch touchscreen, and it's completed by authentic sound effects. The watch is said to carry an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, and it comes with two interchangeable bands.
Each model comes with its own set of playable titles. This Atari 2600 model includes:

Pong
Super Breakout
Missile Command
Centipede
