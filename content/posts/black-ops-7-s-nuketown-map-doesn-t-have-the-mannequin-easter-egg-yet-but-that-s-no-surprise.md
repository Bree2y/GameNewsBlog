# Nuketown’s Iconic Easter Egg Missing in Action: A Covert Mission or Just a Minor Delay?

**Gamers Unlock Hard Mode in Black Ops 7: Waiting for the Easter Egg to Hatch!**

Hold on to your grenades, Call of Duty fans, because Black Ops 7 has just dropped its new version of the fan-favorite Nuketown map! But before you dive into strategic warfare, there's something peculiar in this beloved battleground: that crowd-pleasing Easter egg is still keeping fans on tenterhooks.

## The Hunt for Nuketown's Hidden Secrets

With the release of Nuketown on November 20, gamers have been eagerly swarming the map, outsizing and outsmarting each other to pull off one of their favorite traditions—the infamous mannequin head-shooting spree to unlock the Easter egg. This time, however, it seems like Call of Duty's Easter eggs are still in their nests, and their shells are uncracked.

A clip that gained rapid internet traction by Detonated shows something unexpected—the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 are stubbornly unresponsive. As players attempted to recreate the Easter Egg magic dust from previous versions by high-fiving their bullets with mannequin heads, nothing happened. Not a single limbless mannequin came to life, and the undead dance floor remained empty. 

## Getting Deja Vu in the Call of Duty Universe

If you're thinking this is a glitch in the matrix, think again. This isn't Call of Duty's first rodeo with teasing their fanbase. Black Ops 6 had a similar story: at launch, the streets of Nuketown were eerily silent of Easter egg whispers. The wait was only a tease, however, as the undead mannequins sprang forth not long after, in a rather zombified fashion. 

ScreenRant reminds us of the suspenseful suspense: when Black Ops 6 finally laid down its gauntlet, gamers had to play the waiting game for a good week before they could unlock the hidden delight. So, what's the guesswork for Black Ops 7? Strap in, detective, because all clues point to a potential timeline during the kickoff of Season 1 in early December. Guess we'll just have to sweat it out!

## Speculative Fireworks: What's Next?

Is the Call of Duty team pulling a strategic move to amplify suspense and amplify the thrill, or is the Easter egg just fashionably late for the Nuketown party? The fan theories are running wild, with some speculating a world-building narrative waiting to emerge, while others wonder if a new update will soon yank the covers off something explosive.

As seasoned CoD fans, we're no strangers to dramatic timing and plot twists. For now, cross your fingers, hone your sniper skills, and keep your gaze on the subreddit—a surprise might be lurking right around the corner. Stay frosty, gamers!
