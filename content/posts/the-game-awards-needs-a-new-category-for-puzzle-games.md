# **Puzzle Games Deserve Their Spotlight: Why It's Time for The Game Awards to Add a New Category**

In the gaming cosmos, annual events like The Game Awards spotlight the year’s most dazzling titles, recognizing excellence across a broad spectrum of genres. However, amid the Hollywood-style glamour, a significant star remains largely absent from the awards galaxy—puzzle games. 

Picture this: Tetris, the timeless titan that has mesmerized generations with its simple yet profound gameplay, would likely not find a place among nominees at The Game Awards today. Why, you ask? Because the awards lack a dedicated category that celebrates the intricate brilliance of puzzle gaming.

**Lumines, Blue Prince, and Unpacking Highlight the Gaps**

Puzzle games are about more than just solving riddles; they craft experiences that challenge the mind and stir emotions. Take **Lumines**, for example. Its entrancing blend of music and strategy transforms gameplay into a rhythmic artistry that captivates players. Meanwhile, **Blue Prince** unravels intricate narratives with clever mechanics, providing depth and storytelling through its puzzles. And then there's **Unpacking**, a uniquely poignant game where the simple act of unpacking boxes turns into a journey of self-discovery and narrative brilliance.

Yet, despite their innovation and enchantment, these gems often slip through the cracks when it comes to formal recognition at high-profile awards like The Game Awards. It's clear that the current categories don't quite encapsulate the magic puzzle games bring to our screens.

**A Call for Change**

So, what's the way forward? It's time for The Game Awards to introduce a dedicated category for puzzle games, one that acknowledges and celebrates the artistic and cerebral brilliance of titles that make players think, feel, and reflect. This would not only honor pioneers in the field but also inspire developers to continue pushing the boundaries of what puzzle games can achieve.

Imagine an awards show where puzzle games finally receive their due—a night where the cleverness of **Portal** can stand alongside the intricacies of **The Witness**, where the strategic elegance of **Baba Is You** is applauded with the same fervor as blockbuster action titles.

With gaming expanding rapidly across diverse genres and platforms, it’s crucial that our celebrations of it evolve too. By acknowledging the unique contributions of puzzle games, The Game Awards can ensure every facet of gaming gets its moment in the spotlight.

**Conclusion**

As gamers, creators, and critics continue to navigate the evolving landscape of interactive entertainment, it's paramount that we advocate for the appreciation of all genres. Puzzle games, in their artful design and narrative prowess, are undeniably worthy of their own distinguished recognition.
