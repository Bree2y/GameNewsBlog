# Rediscover the High Seas: Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake Rumored for Early 2026 Release!

Ahoy, mateys! Exciting whispers are catching the winds in the gaming world today about the potential return of a beloved classic. Rumor has it that the pirate adventures of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag are being given a fresh coat of paint. Set sail with us as we dive into the latest gossip about Ubisoft's secret project poised for an early 2026 release.

According to an intriguing piece from Insider Gaming, corroborated by the ever-reliable Eurogamer, Ubisoft may be plotting a grand comeback for the legendary saga of Edward Kenway. The whispers suggest this could be none other than a remake of the iconic Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, aiming to reach gamers before March 31, 2026. If the stars align, we could be swabbing the decks and manning the cannons as early as the week of March 23.

The mystery unraveled following the release of Ubisoft's latest earnings report, which held its secrets tightly until the very end. The report intriguingly hinted at an "unannounced game" scheduled for release by the conclusion of its fiscal year. Following a delay—thanks to a last-minute closure of the financial semester, as Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet noted—the pieces of the puzzle began to align. And all eyes turned towards the high seas of Black Flag.

Although Ubisoft stays silent, maintaining a stoic demeanor amidst swirling rumors, the gaming community is abuzz with excitement. The rumor mill kicked into high gear back in June 2023, with whispers about the remake's development seeping into the ether. Fast forward to March 2025, when a Pure Arts livestream seemingly confirmed Black Flag's resurgence, adding fuel to the speculative fire that Edward Kenway's seafaring exploits were primed for a grand revival.

Adding another layer to the speculation, Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, teased us with tantalizing hints in June 2025, suggesting his iconic character may raise his pirate flag once more.

One element that stands out as intriguing is the rumor that this remake won't include the modern-day gaming sections that were met with mixed reviews in the original. Instead, players might be treated to a richer, more immersive piratical narrative.

So, keep those telescopes focused on the horizon and your ears to the ground. As whispers morph into announcements, one can't help but anticipate Ubisoft's official word confirming our return to the adventurous life on the high seas. Stay tuned for updates as this storyline develops and get ready to hoist the black flag once again!
