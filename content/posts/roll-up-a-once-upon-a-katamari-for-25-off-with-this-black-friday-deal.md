Like the other Katamari games, Once Upon a Katamari kicks off with the King of the Cosmos causing unintentional chaos. As the Prince, it’s up to you to clean up his blunder and restore the universe to its former glory. With over 50 levels spread across nine distinct eras, the Prince has his work cut out for him as he explores the Jurassic Era, Ice Age, historic Japan, and more major moments in history. Outside of the single-player campaign, Once Upon a Katamari also has a four-player mode called "KatamariBall," where everyone competes in a cosmic sports game. 
The standard PS5 and Switch editions include the full base game. The physical Switch edition of Once Upon a Katamari is also backward-compatible with Switch 2.

"Once Upon a Katamari is still a fantastic time and the new must-play title in the series. It manages to perfectly capture what has always made Katamari so charming and special--the writing, the humor, the music, the absurdity of it all--and refines it into the best way to experience the series, regardless of if it's your first time playing or if you're a long-time fan," Jessica Cogswell wrote in GameSpot's Once Upon a Katamari review.
