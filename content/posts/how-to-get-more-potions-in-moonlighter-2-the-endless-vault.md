# Maximizing Your Potion Potential in Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault

Greetings, fellow dungeon-delvers and relic hunters! If you're diving into the captivating world of *Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault*, you're surely discovering that the art of roguelite exploration and entrepreneurial prowess go hand-in-hand. The essence of a successful jaunt through those intimidating, relic-filled corridors often boils down to a simple truth: you can never have enough potions. So let's delve into the magical secrets of maximizing your potion stash to extend those lucrative adventures and best those formidable foes!

## Seeking Immortality With Extra Potions

One of the most significant upgrades you can acquire is the ability to carry additional potions on your expeditions. These precious vials of life can mean the difference between stumbling back to town with a backpack full of relics or retracing your steps from a checkpoint with empty pockets. But how, you ask, do we secure extra potion uses and superior elixirs? The answer lies in the heart of your bustling village.

### Meet Your Potion Provider: Eris the Witch

Nestled cozily next door to your quaint little shop, just to the south, resides Eris the Witch. This mystical maven is your go-to guru for all potion-related enhancements. She offers a trove of upgrades split into four progressive sections, each unlocking in its own unique way. The very first panel is accessible from the get-go, leading you down a path of incrementally rewarding investments.

Hit a sweet milestone of 50,000 coins with your relentless quests through the Endless Vault, and voila! You’ll unlock the second upgrade section. Eris doesn’t just trade in potions for gold; you’ll also need to scavenge various crafting materials from the dungeons' menagerie of adversaries. These materials correspond to the upgrades on offer, often tethered to the enemies found in the areas you’re scouring.

### Upgrades that Make a Difference

The potion-related opportunities Eris provides are not just about increasing quantity, but quality too. Expect access to enhanced healing brews that breathe new life into your character or pedestals that conveniently restore spent potions during your forays. These upgrades can be pivotal for those looking to face longer, more demanding dungeon crawls.

### Prepare for Adventuring Success

With a bit of planning, collectible currency, and an investment in the right potion upgrades, your journeys in *Moonlighter 2* can reach new heights of efficiency and excitement. Stack your supplies, study your enemy, and prepare to walk away with not just stories of survival, but the spoils of a true adventurer.

Eager to turn those extra potion uses into pure profit? Make a visit to Eris a top priority, and soon you'll be navigating The Endless Vault with ease and grace.

Happy exploring, and may your potion bottles always be full!
