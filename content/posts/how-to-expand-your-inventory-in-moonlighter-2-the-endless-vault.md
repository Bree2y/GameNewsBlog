# Unlock Your Inner Merchant: Expanding Your Inventory in Moonlighter 2 - The Endless Vault

Hey there, fellow adventurers and budding shopkeepers! If you've embarked on the mesmerizing journey that is **Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault**, you're already well-acquainted with the thrilling blend of dungeon-crawling and shop management that this game offers. But let's face it—while delving into the mysterious depths is exhilarating, the real game-changer is what you bring back to your shop. That’s right; we’re talking about relics!

The more relics you lug back to town, the more goodies you have to sell, and the more treasure piles up in your vault. But, alas, your backpack isn't a bottomless pit. Fear not, though! With a bit of guidance, you’ll learn how to stretch your inventory space to its limits. Here’s your ultimate guide on how to optimize your schlepping capacity in Moonlighter 2.

## Meet Your Key to Expansion: Sliver, the NPC

Your ticket to hoarding more relics lies with a charming NPC named **Sliver**. Before you can purchase those precious inventory slots, you need to do a bit of adventuring. Start by heading to **Kalina**, the starting zone of your adventure. There, you’ll encounter Sliver in what’s called a “?” room.

While stumbling upon him isn't always a given, as there are a few characters who might show up, don't fret too much. Kalina isn't too challenging, and you can make multiple runs until luck smiles your way.

## Setting Up Shop With Sliver

Once you've crossed paths with Sliver in the dungeon depths, he’ll begin chilling out in your town's western section. Here’s where the real fun starts! Start by purchasing your first additional inventory slot for 4,000 glittering gold coins. Had enough fun with that extra space? The second slot is yours for 8,000 gold. Prices rise as you go, but think of it as an investment in your future retail empire!

## Looking Ahead: Even More Space

Currently, there’s another row of slots just waiting to be unlocked, which will likely require special crafting materials not yet available in the early access version. But keep your exploration hat on, because updates are sure to bring more ways to carry your loot.

## Bonus Tip: Potions!

Since you're expanding and exploring, don’t forget to stockpile on **potions**. You’ll need every edge in this roguelike experience to ensure you’re always one step ahead of those pesky dungeon denizens intent on standing between you and your precious loot.

So go ahead, expand that inventory, and turn your humble shop into a bustling hub of commerce! In Moonlighter 2, your entrepreneurial spirit is the key to untold riches and endless adventure. Now get out there and make your mark, brave Moonlighter!
