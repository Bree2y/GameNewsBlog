If you clicked on this article earlier in the week, you browsed a list of roughly 85 deals on physical games for Switch 1/2. Many of the early Black Friday Switch deals are still available, but they have been joined by so many others. Our list has practically doubled in size, so now Switch and Switch 2 players have around 170 game deals to check out below. And if you haven't already, you may want to bookmark this page, because we'll continue to update this roundup throughout <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/\">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Week.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4a2emKK\">See Switch deals at Amazon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4oKofBC\">See Switch 2 deals at Amazon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nUYU6z\">See all gaming deals at Amazon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FxLW6o3&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fmashup%2F%3Ftype%3D11&event_type=click\">See Switch game deals at Best Buy</a></li></ul><p>We separated Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch games into two lists, but keep in mind that original Switch games are playable on Nintendo's new console. Some original Switch games have received free or paid Switch 2 upgrades, and others simply run better on the more powerful hardware by default.</p><h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pfS4JQ\">Black Friday Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals</a></h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 list is, rather unsurprisingly, significantly shorter than the Switch list, but there are numerous titles on sale for all-time low prices, including recent releases like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PAC-MAN-WORLD-Re-PAC-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0FK7YV5RB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Nightmares-III-Nintendo-Switch-Deluxe/dp/B0FDT6LHV6?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">Little Nightmares III</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKVWSM3N?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">Cronos</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Outlaws-Gold-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">Star Wars Outlaws: Gold Edition</a>, which is discounted to $40 (was $60) at Amazon. The sports game deals are even better than earlier in the week, as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Madden-NFL-26-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F6481V7V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">Madden NFL 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-FC-26-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FH16KDQG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">EA Sports FC 26</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K26-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0FH5DPB28?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20\">NBA 2K26</a> are going for $30 (was $70) each. Harry Potter fans can get the Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy for a new all-time low of $45 (was $60).</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-black-friday-game-deals-available-now/1100-6535728/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

If you clicked on this article earlier in the week, you browsed a list of roughly 85 deals on physical games for Switch 1/2. Many of the early Black Friday Switch deals are still available, but they have been joined by so many others. Our list has practically doubled in size, so now Switch and Switch 2 players have around 170 game deals to check out below. And if you haven't already, you may want to bookmark this page, because we'll continue to update this roundup throughout Black Friday and Cyber Week.\n\nSee Switch deals at Amazon\nSee Switch 2 deals at Amazon\nSee all gaming deals at Amazon\nSee Switch game deals at Best Buy\n\nWe separated Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch games into two lists, but keep in mind that original Switch games are playable on Nintendo's new console. Some original Switch games have received free or paid Switch 2 upgrades, and others simply run better on the more powerful hardware by default.\nBlack Friday Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 list is, rather unsurprisingly, significantly shorter than the Switch list, but there are numerous titles on sale for all-time low prices, including recent releases like Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, Little Nightmares III, Cronos, and Star Wars Outlaws: Gold Edition, which is discounted to $40 (was $60) at Amazon. The sports game deals are even better than earlier in the week, as Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and NBA 2K26 are going for $30 (was $70) each. Harry Potter fans can get the Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy for a new all-time low of $45 (was $60).\nContinue Reading at GameSpot",

With over 50 levels spread across nine distinct eras, the Prince has his work cut out for him as he explores the Jurassic Era, Ice Age, historic Japan, and more major moments in history. Outside of the single-player campaign, Once Upon a Katamari also has a four-player mode called \"KatamariBall,\" where everyone competes in a cosmic sports game. \nThe standard PS5 and Switch editions include the full base game. The physical Switch edition of Once Upon a Katamari is also backward-compatible with Switch 2.\n                \n                  \n                      See at Amazon                              \n                                                                      \n                        See at Best Buy           \n                                                     \n      \n   \n \n\"Once Upon a Katamari is still a fantastic time and the new must-play title in the series. It manages to perfectly capture what has always made Katamari so charming and special--the writing, the humor, the music, the absurdity of it all--and refines it into the best way to experience the series, regardless of if it's your first time playing or if you're a long-time fan,\" Jessica Cogswell wrote in GameSpot's Once Upon a Katamari review.\nOne the hunt for more early Black Friday video game deals?
